This is going to be a silly little to-do list app using 
vanilla html, css & javascript. I'm hoping to make it both 
functional but also aesthetically pleasing. 

I want it to be able to add to-do list objects, delete to do
list objects, display them, delete them all, add more, and
maybe even color code them. 

As always, let me know what you would change, how you would
have done it differently, and what you want to see from me
in the future.
